Notes from 3.5.2 -> 3.5.3

added easier calls for GetCops 

added support for qs phone emails

added option for minigames 'none' so its not required


3.5.3 - > 3.5.4

1) Removed Config.imagelink - too tired of people not changing that and then asking me why images wont load.
  - should work for qb, ps, lj, ox, qs, core, origen. if you use another inventory go to line 147 of the functions.lua in the client folder 
      - make this adjustment
        ```
          elseif GetResourceState('yourinventoryname') == 'started' then
		          return "nui:/yourinventoryname/folder1/folder2/".. QBCore.Shared.Items[img].image
        ```
2 )small bug fixes in meth.lua client side
3) small bug fixes in pharma.lua server side
4) bug allowing to see target for drying weed when waiting for the weed to dry patched

3.5.4 - > 3.5.5
Updated small tweaks to client and server functions.lua


3.5.5 - > 3.5.6
updated mainly client/server functions.lua to include a check for if using scully emotes then use the export to cancel emote once done with progressbar, added support for a few other inventories and dispatch

added new item box events for additem and removeitem functions in the server/functions.lua
I left the original itembox event in, if you dont use the old event it will just trigger to a blank event and the next event will trigger, its a duct tape backwards compat method

3.5.6 - > 3.5.7

added a couple new functions to cut back on repeating natives needed ( Freeze() ) will now set an entitys heading, block temp events, freeze, and set invincible)
added better calls for GetImage and GetLabel for ox inventory
converted all callbacks to lib.callback to increase optimization
should be fully compatible with qbx without needing to make a couple edits now

3.5.7 - > 3.5.8 
Added support for fivemerr logs
3.5.8 -> 3.5.9 
added command /cornersell **you only need to update server/cornserselling.lua** from previous update

3.5.9 - > 3.7.0

im bad at numbers sue me kek

a lot has been changed with this version 
The main thing to update from 3.5.9 to 3.7.0 is a couple things in your config 
SAVE YOUR SHARED FOLDER AND COPY AND PASTE IT TO YOUR DESKTOP SO YOU HAVE A SECOND COPY

```
Config.oxtarget:
 no longer exists in new version. Change it to 

Config.Target = 'qb' -- qb or ox

Config.minigametype:
changed a little bit. you need to add this table to make things work now

Config.Minigames = {
    ps =            {    amount = 2,     speed = 8,},
    ox =            { 'easy', 'easy'},   --easy medium or hard each one corresponds to how many skillchecks and the difficulty
    blcirprog =     {    amount = 2,     speed = 50},       -- speed = 1-100
    blprog =        {    amount = 1,     speed = 50},       -- speed = 1-100
    blkeyspam =     {    amount = 1,     difficulty = 50}, -- difficulty = 1-100
    blkeycircle =   {    amount = 1,     difficulty = 50, keynumbers = 3},
    blnumberslide = {    amount = 1,     difficulty = 50, keynumbers = 3},
    blrapidlines =  {    amount = 1,     difficulty = 50, numberofline = 3},
    blcircleshake = {    amount = 1,     difficulty = 50, stages = 3},
    glpath =        {    gridsize = 10,  lives = 3,     timelimit = 999999},
    glspot =        {gridSize = 6, timeLimit = 999999, charSet = "alphabet", required = 10},
    glmath =        {timeLimit = 300000},

}

what does this do, adds 10 more minigames than before you can use. How to set it, change Config.minigametype to the key of that table like ps ox blcirprog

```

Now thats the config changes so you dont need to reconfig everything as I do my best to not change much in the config and work around what has been done 

Whats been added
```
i moved tier system to SQL as its better than using metadata
run the SQL and it will autopopulate your metadata for rep so people wont lose anything

I added a new sql table for deliveries

it not checks overall time for deliveries regardless if you crash or not.

Added new server file called recipes.lua

its what you imagine, about 80-90% of the recipes for md-drugs

```

Is there bugs, probably. But im tired of beta testing it over and over so please report bugs to my discord where i can see them and patch them quickly. 


3.7.0 -> 3.7.1
slight bug fixes with ox items, meth targeting
