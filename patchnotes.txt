Notes from 3.5.2 -> 3.5.3

added easier calls for GetCops 

added support for qs phone emails

added option for minigames 'none' so its not required


3.5.3 - > 3.5.4

1) Removed Config.imagelink - too tired of people not changing that and then asking me why images wont load.
  - should work for qb, ps, lj, ox, qs, core, origen. if you use another inventory go to line 147 of the functions.lua in the client folder 
      - make this adjustment
        ```
          elseif GetResourceState('yourinventoryname') == 'started' then
		          return "nui:/yourinventoryname/folder1/folder2/".. QBCore.Shared.Items[img].image
        ```
2 )small bug fixes in meth.lua client side
3) small bug fixes in pharma.lua server side
4) bug allowing to see target for drying weed when waiting for the weed to dry patched

3.5.4 - > 3.5.5
Updated small tweaks to client and server functions.lua


3.5.5 - > 3.5.6
updated mainly client/server functions.lua to include a check for if using scully emotes then use the export to cancel emote once done with progressbar, added support for a few other inventories and dispatch

added new item box events for additem and removeitem functions in the server/functions.lua
I left the original itembox event in, if you dont use the old event it will just trigger to a blank event and the next event will trigger, its a duct tape backwards compat method

3.5.6 - > 3.5.7

added a couple new functions to cut back on repeating natives needed ( Freeze() ) will now set an entitys heading, block temp events, freeze, and set invincible)
added better calls for GetImage and GetLabel for ox inventory
converted all callbacks to lib.callback to increase optimization
should be fully compatible with qbx without needing to make a couple edits now

3.5.7 - > 3.5.8 
Added support for fivemerr logs
